# tone generator
a basic simple tone generator for python.
I have an audio related background and once i figured out there were audio options for python, i decided to give this a try.
Not too impressive, but the simple code I found online allowed me to experiment and make changes.
I never take credit for work unless it is fully 1005 mine, so thank you to my fellow python friend for creating this template.
hopefully this code helps you if your just starting out too.

You may have to change some things yourself. so far, adjusting F2 to a frequency produces an output.
try messing with the volume and fs parameters as well.
